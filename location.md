The ceremony and reception will be held at the beautiful [Dwór Złotopolska Dolina](http://www.zlotopolskadolina.pl).

The wedding venue does have limited rooms available and these are open to our
guests on a first come first serve basis.
Please contact us directly if you would like to reserve one of these rooms.

For those who would like to arrange their own accommodation then all the usual
options (hotels/AirBnB) are available within short driving/taxi distances from
the venue. The prices per night for hotels in the area (Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki)
range from £20 -£50 for a double room.
