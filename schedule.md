The ceremony will begin at **4pm** outside (but covered) in the garden of the Manor
House.

After the ceremony, everyone will make their way into the reception room
where the festivities will begin! Please make sure you are very hungry as there
is a great deal of food served at Polish weddings – expect the party to last
until the early morning (**4-5am**).

All food and drink (including alcohol) will be provided by us so you’ll only need
money for a taxi back to the hotel at the end of the night!

There will be a lot of vodka provided along with rum, whiskey, wine & draught beer.

If you have any specific alcohol requests or dietary requirements, please let us
know as soon as possible.

We do not have gift list as we understand that so many of you will be travelling
from afar and will have to cover hotel and travel expenses… so the biggest gift
for us is that you can spend this amazing day with us!

However, if you really would like to give us a wedding gift, we would appreciate
if it can fit in an envelope.
